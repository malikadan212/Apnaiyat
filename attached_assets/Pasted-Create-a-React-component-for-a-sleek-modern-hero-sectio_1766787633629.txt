Create a React component for a sleek, modern hero section (first section) of a landing page. The platform is Apnaiyat, a security-first crowdfunding site focused on transparent, fraud-proof donations for families in need. Use Tailwind CSS for styling (assume it's set up in the project or include the CDN if needed). Make it fully responsive.
Reference this example structure from CrowdFundo's landing page, but adapt it to Apnaiyat:

Top navigation bar with logo on left (hands shield icon + "APNAIYAT" text), menu items (Home, For Donors, For NGOs/Charities, How It Works, About Us), a chat icon, and a "Sign Up" button on right.
Hero background: A full-width image or gradient with an empathetic helping scene (use a placeholder URL like 'https://via.placeholder.com/1920x1080?text=Empathetic+Helping+Scene' for now). Add subtle wave patterns or dots in the background for modernity (use CSS for waves if possible).
Overlay headline: "With your secure support, we ensure every donation reaches families in need—transparently and without fraud." Highlight "secure" in a light green color.
Floating campaign card on the bottom-right: Show raised amount (e.g., "PKR 232,032 Raised"), progress bar (48% filled in green), donor count (412 Donors), description ("Secure donations for families affected by emergencies."), and two buttons ("Start Donating" white on green, "Sign Up Now" black on white).
Subtle elements: Tagline below headline: "Secure, verified donations reaching families in need" in smaller font.

Use Framer Motion for animations:

Fade-in and slight upward slide for the headline and tagline on initial mount (duration: 1s, ease: [0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1]).
Gentle scale-up (from 0.95 to 1) and opacity fade for the logo.
Fade-in from right for the floating campaign card (duration: 1.2s).
On hover, scale buttons up by 1.05 with a smooth transition (use motion.button).
Animate the progress bar to fill from 0% to 48% on mount (duration: 1.5s).

Brand colors and assets:

Primary: Dark green (#005F4B) for text, buttons, accents.
Secondary: Light green (#4B9C8A) for highlights, progress bars.
Background: Light beige (#F5F2EB).
Logo: Describe as a shield made of hands with "APNAIYAT" text (use text-based or a placeholder SVG/img for now).
Typography: Modern sans-serif (e.g., import Inter or Roboto from Google Fonts).

Import necessary libraries: React, Framer Motion (assume installed via npm in Replit: npm install framer-motion). Ensure accessibility (aria labels, etc.). Output the full code for a HeroSection component that can be exported and used in App.js, including any imports.
